  ## Introduction

  This example shows how to implement a subscription settings icon dropdown. This lets the user to change their subscription settings without navigating away from the email. It also works for websites.

    <!-- ## Setup -->

    <!--
      We use an [`amp-list`](/documentation/components/amp-list) component to query the user's current subscription setting on email or page load from the server.
    -->
    <script async custom-element="amp-list" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-list-0.1.js"></script>

    <!--
      We'll use [`amp-mustache`](/documentation/components/amp-mustache) to render the dropdown icon linked to the server responded subscription state.
    -->
    <script async custom-template="amp-mustache" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-mustache-0.2.js"></script>

    <!--
      We'll also use [`amp-form`](/documentation/components/amp-form) to update the user's subscription setting on the server when they select a new setting from the icon dropdown.
    -->
    <script async custom-element="amp-form" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-form-0.1.js"></script>

    <!--
      Lastly, we use [`amp-bind`](/documentation/components/amp-bind) to update the dropdown's state in response to events.

    <!-- ## Implementation -->
    <!--
      ### Server

      The server responds to [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) and [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) requests at `<% base_path %>/subscription`.

      It responds to GET requests with a JSON object like the following:
      ```json
      {
        "currentSubscription": "only-mentions",
        "options": [
          {
            "value": "watching",
            "isSelected": false,
            "text": "Watching",
            "imgUrl": "/images/watching.jpg"
          },
          {
            "value": "only-mentions",
            "isSelected": true,
            "text": "Only mentions",
            "imgUrl": "/images/only-mentions.jpg"
          },
          {
            "value": "ignoring",
            "isSelected": false,
            "text": "Ignoring",
            "imgUrl": "/images/ignoring.jpg"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
      `currentSubscription` and `isSelected` vary depending on the user's current subscription setting. `isSelected` is only `true` for one of the objects in `options` at a time.

      The server expects POST requests to specify one of the subscription settings above (e.g. `ignoring`) for a `nextSubscription` field in its form data. It then updates the user's current subscription setting to the specified value.
    -->

    <!--
      ### AMP-HTML

      #### Step 1: Basic Dropdown

      We start with a native [`select`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element for our dropdown and fill it with our supported subscription settings. The `select` element is a great choice because it is highly accessible on all platforms.
    -->
    <select>
      <option value="watching">Watching</option>
      <option value="only-mentions">Only mentions</option>
      <option value="ignoring">Ignoring</option>
    </select>

    <!--
      #### Step 2: Fetching the Current Subscription Setting

      We wrap the `select` element in an `amp-list` and set its `src` to the URL our server is listening for GET requests. This queries the user's current subscription setting.

      We use an `amp-mustache` template to render the `select` element and ensure that the `option` element corresponding to the user's subscription setting has the `selected` attribute. To understand why the code is duplicative, consider that the `selected` attribute is a [boolean attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute) and review the [`amp-mustache` restrictions](/documentation/components/amp-mustache/#restrictions).

      Finally, we add a [placeholder and fallback](/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/placeholders) to keep the user informed about the state of the user interface and gracefully handle any issues.
    -->
    <amp-list src="<% base_path %>/subscription" binding="refresh" items="." single-item layout="fill">
      <template type="amp-mustache">
        <select>
          {{#options}}
            {{#isSelected}}
              <option value="{{value}}" selected>
                {{text}}
              </option>
            {{/isSelected}}
            {{^isSelected}}
              <option value="{{value}}">
                {{text}}
              </option>
            {{/isSelected}}
          {{/options}}
        </select>
      </template>
      <div placeholder>Loading...</div>
      <div fallback>Something went wrong. Please refresh</div>
    </amp-list>

    <!--
      Note that the `amp-list` is annotated with [`single-item`](/documentation/components/amp-list#single-item) because our server responds to GET requests with a single logical value (the subscription setting) and we only want the template to be invoked once for the response. Setting [`items="."`](/documentation/components/amp-list#items) ensures that the template can access the response object's root fields.
    -->

    <!--
      #### Step 3: Updating the Subscription Setting on Selection

      To update the user's subscription setting on the server when they select a new setting, we start by wrapping the `select` element in an [AMP `form`](/documentation/components/amp-form) element, setting its `method` to `post`, and setting its `action-xhr` attribute to the URL where our server is listening for POST requests.

      The `name` attribute of the `select` element is set to `nextSubscription`. `nextSubscription` is the name of the form data field where the server expects the user's new subscription setting to be in the POST request (see the [Server section](<% base_path %>/#server)) and the `select` element contains the user's selected subscription setting.

      Finally, we trigger the form submission when the `select` element's value changes. We do so by using the [`on` attribute](/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/common_attributes#on) to attach an event handler to the `select` element's [`change` event](/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events#input-elements), invoking the `form` element's [`submit` action](/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events#form_1). Note that we gave the `form` element an `id` so that we could refer to it in the event handler.

      You can test the code by selecting a new subscription setting and refreshing the page. The `select` element's subscription setting on page load is now the one you selected!
    -->
    <amp-list src="<% base_path %>/subscription" binding="refresh" items="." single-item layout="fill">
      <template type="amp-mustache">
        <form action-xhr="<% base_path %>/subscription" method="post" id="form1">
          <select name="nextSubscription" on="change: form1.submit;">
            {{#options}}
              {{#isSelected}}
                <option value="{{value}}" selected>
                  {{text}}
                </option>
              {{/isSelected}}
              {{^isSelected}}
                <option value="{{value}}">
                  {{text}}
                </option>
              {{/isSelected}}
            {{/options}}
          </select>
        </form>
      </template>
      <div placeholder>Loading...</div>
      <div fallback>Something went wrong. Please refresh</div>
    </amp-list>

    <!--
      #### Step 4: Disabling While Submitting

      After selecting a new subscription setting from the dropdown, it is unclear when the form is submitting or submitted. Furthermore, nothing prevents the user from attempting to select a new subscription setting while the form is still submitting.

      Ideally the `select` element would be [disabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) while the form is submitting. However, there's a problem with this approach: [values of disabled inputs are not submitted with a form](https://www.w3.org/TR/PR-html40-971107/interact/forms.html#:~:text=Values%20of%20disabled%20controls%20are%20not%20submitted%20with%20a%20form.). Under different circumstances we might consider using the [`readonly`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) attribute instead of the `disabled` attribute to avoid this problem, but the [`select` element does not support the `readonly` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly#wikiArticle:~:text=The%20attribute%20is%20not%20supported%20or%20relevant%20to%20%3Cselect%3E%20or). Fortunately, we can solve this problem by submitting the `select` element's value through a new [hidden `input` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/hidden), which doesn't need to be disabled because users cannot interact with or see it, that we ensure always contains the same value as the `select` element.

      We start by adding a hidden `input` element, and moving the `name` of the `select` element to the hidden `input` element so that its value submits. To keep the hidden `input` element's value in sync with the `select` element's value, we update a new `nextSubscription` state variable using [`AMP.setState`](/documentation/components/amp-bind#updating-state-variables-with-amp.setstate()) whenever the `select` element's value changes and [bind](/documentation/components/amp-bind#bindings) the hidden `input` element's `value` attribute to the state variable.

      To disable the `select` element we need a state variable that represents whether the form is currently submitting that we can use in the `select` element's `disabled` attribute binding. We reuse the `nextSubscription` state variable by ensuring it is `null` when the form is _not_ submitting by updating `nextSubscription` to `null` on the `submit-success` and `submit-error` events of the `form` element. Finally, we bind the `select` element's `disabled` attribute to `!!nextSubscription` because the state variable is truthy when the form is submitting. We do the same for each of its `option` elements to prevent the user from using the keyboard to switch between the values while the form is submitting.
    -->
    <amp-list src="<% base_path %>/subscription" binding="refresh" items="." single-item layout="fill">
      <template type="amp-mustache">
        <form action-xhr="<% base_path %>/subscription" method="post" id="form2"
          on="submit-success: AMP.setState({ nextSubscription: null });
            submit-error: AMP.setState({ nextSubscription: null });">
          <input type="hidden" name="nextSubscription" [value]="nextSubscription">
          <select
            on="change: AMP.setState({ nextSubscription: event.value }), form2.submit;"
            [disabled]="!!nextSubscription">
            {{#options}}
              {{#isSelected}}
                <option value="{{value}}" [disabled]="!!nextSubscription" selected>
                  {{text}}
                </option>
              {{/isSelected}}
              {{^isSelected}}
                <option value="{{value}}" [disabled]="!!nextSubscription">
                  {{text}}
                </option>
              {{/isSelected}}
            {{/options}}
          </select>
        </form>
      </template>
      <div placeholder>Loading...</div>
      <div fallback>Something went wrong. Please refresh</div>
    </amp-list>

    <!--
      Note that despite the `disabled` attribute being a [boolean attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-author-20110809/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute), we can still effectively bind it because [`amp-bind` will remove the attribute when the binding expression is `false`](/documentation/components/amp-bind#bindings:~:text=Boolean%20expression%20results%20toggle%20boolean%20attributes.,false%2C%20the%20controls%20attribute%20is%20removed.).
    -->

    <!--
      #### Step 5: Handling Form Submission Failure

      We need to display an error message and revert the `select` element to its previous value if the form fails to submit.

      To display an error message when the form fails to submit, we add element containing our error message to the `form` element's children. We annotate the child element with the [`submit-error` attribute](/documentation/components/amp-form#submit-error). This attribute ensures that the element is only visible after a failed form submission.

      Reverting the `select` element's value to its previous value requires binding the `selected` attribute of each `option` element. This requires maintaining the `select` element's current value in a `currentSubscription` state variable and the element's previous value in a `previousSubscription` state variable.

      When the `select` element's value changes, we set `currentSubscription` to the new value and `previousSubscription` to the element's previous value. We store these in the `currentSubscription` state variable, if this is not the first time the element's value has changed. Otherwise, it's stored in the `currentSubscription` field of the `amp-list` response.

      We ensure the `select` element's selected `option` stays in sync with `currentSubscription` by binding the `selected` attribute of each `option`. Finally, we revert the `select` element to its previous value on form submission failure by setting `currentSubscription` to `previousSubscription` in the `form` element's `submit-error` event.

      The following code snippet is configured to fail form submissions. Test out the new behavior!
     -->
    <amp-list src="<% base_path %>/subscription" binding="refresh" items="." single-item layout="fill">
      <template type="amp-mustache">
        <form action-xhr="<% base_path %>/subscription?fail=true" method="post" id="form3"
          on="submit-success: AMP.setState({ nextSubscription: null });
            submit-error:
              AMP.setState({
                currentSubscription: previousSubscription,
                nextSubscription: null
              });">
          <input type="hidden" name="nextSubscription" [value]="nextSubscription">
          <select
            on="change:
                AMP.setState({
                  previousSubscription: currentSubscription || '{{currentSubscription}}',
                  currentSubscription: event.value,
                  nextSubscription: event.value
                }),
                form3.submit;"
            [disabled]="!!nextSubscription">
            {{#options}}
              {{#isSelected}}
                <option value="{{value}}" [disabled]="!!nextSubscription"
                  selected [selected]="(currentSubscription || '{{currentSubscription}}') == '{{value}}'">
                  {{text}}
                </option>
              {{/isSelected}}
              {{^isSelected}}
                <option value="{{value}}" [disabled]="!!nextSubscription"
                  [selected]="(currentSubscription || '{{currentSubscription}}') == '{{value}}'">
                  {{text}}
                </option>
              {{/isSelected}}
            {{/options}}
          </select>
          <div submit-error>Something went wrong. Please try again</div>
        </form>
      </template>
      <div placeholder>Loading...</div>
      <div fallback>Something went wrong. Please refresh</div>
    </amp-list>

    <!--
      #### Step 6: Icon Dropdown

      Styling the `select` element itself to look like an icon using only CSS supported by email clients isn't feasible. Instead, we'll hide the `select` element's persistent user interface (the box showing the current value), and show a different icon for each dropdown state in its place. However, we'll keep the dropdown shown on click.

      Fortunately, styling `select` affects the persistent user interface while styling `option` affects the dropdown. We can use this fact to hide the former, but keep the latter. Of the three common choices for hiding an element using CSS ([`display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;`, and `opacity: 0;`](https://magnusbenoni.com/difference-between-display-visibility-opacity)), `opacity: 0;` is most suited because we want to keep the element in the tab order as well as keep receiving its click events:
      ```css
      .subscription-select {
        opacity: 0;
        cursor: pointer;
      }
      ```
      We also set `cursor: pointer;` for the `select` element because it looks like a button now.

      The next step is to create a new icon-based user interface. We start with a `div` element containing an [`amp-img`](/documentation/components/amp-img) component for each subscription setting. The `div` element is annotated with the following `icon` CSS class, which hides all of the images by default:
      ```css
      .icon > * {
        visibility: hidden;
      }
      ```

      The `amp-img` component corresponding to the current state of the `select` element is made visible using the following `visible` CSS class:
      ```css
      .visible {
        visibility: visible;
      }
      ```
      If the `select` element's value has not changed, then we determine the current state of the `select` element from the `isSelected` fields in the `amp-list` response. Otherwise, we determine the current state from the `currentSubscription` state variable.

      Although at most one `amp-img` component is visible at a time, each component still takes up space on the page. This means that the components will be positioned one below the other by default. Using the `display` property instead of the `visibility` property would fix this issue, but it would cause the icon to flicker between subscription setting changes because AMP does not preload `amp-img` components that start out as `display: none;`. Instead, we use the following `relative` and `absolute` CSS classes to stack the `amp-img` component on top of each other on the z axis:
      ```css
      .relative {
        position: relative;
      }

      .absolute {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        right: 0;
        bottom: 0;
        left: 0;
      }
      ```
      Note that the stacking order of the `amp-img` components relative to each other doesn't matter because at most one is visible at a time.

       We also use these CSS classes to position the icons _behind_ the invisible `select` user interface so that when a user tries to click on one of our icons they'll actually be clicking on the invisible `select` element and triggering its events! We keep our new icons behind the `select` element by placing the icon's code before the `select` element's code (see [Stacking without the `z-index` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/Stacking_without_z-index)).

      We ensure the `select` element's click target bounding box is the same size as the icons using the following `icon-sized` CSS class:
      ```css
      .icon-sized {
        width: 30px;
        height: 30px;
      }
      ```

      Screen readers can get all of the information they need from the `select` element so we make the icons invisible to screen readers using the [`aria-hidden` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-hidden).

      Finally, we display an outline around the icons when the `select` element is focused using the [`:focus-within` pseudo selector](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/f/focus-within):
      ```css
      .icon-container:focus-within {
        outline-offset: 2px;
        outline: 1px solid black;
        outline: -webkit-focus-ring-color auto 1px;
      }
      ```

      And we're done!
